Title: Large Scale Database Project - FIFA Data Management System
1. Introduction
This document provides an in-depth explanation of the FIFA Data Management System, a Spring Boot-based application designed to handle large-scale football-related data. The system manages information about players, clubs, coaches, and users while integrating high-query services for complex data processing.
2. System Overview
The system follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and is structured into multiple layers:
Models: Represent the core entities such as Player, Club, Coach, and User.
Repositories: Interact with the database to perform CRUD operations.
Services: Contain business logic for managing football data.
Controllers: Handle HTTP requests and API endpoints.
Security Configuration: Implements authentication and authorization.
3. Technologies Used
Backend: Java, Spring Boot
Database: Neo4j (Graph Database) or a relational database (depending on configuration)
Security: Spring Security
API Communication: RESTful APIs
4. Database Schema
4.1 Entities and Relationships
The key entities in the system include:
Player: Represents a football player with attributes like name, position, and team.
Club: Represents a football club with details such as name and location.
Coach: Represents a football coach managing a team.
User: Represents system users who interact with the platform.
4.2 Relationships
A Player belongs to a Club.
A Coach manages a Club.
A User can follow multiple Players and Coaches.
5. API Endpoints
5.1 Player API
GET /players: Retrieve all players.
POST /players: Add a new player.
GET /players/{id}: Get details of a specific player.
5.2 Club API
GET /clubs: Retrieve all clubs.
POST /clubs: Create a new club.
GET /clubs/{id}: Get club details.
5.3 User API
POST /users: Register a new user.
POST /users/follow/player: Follow a player.
POST /users/follow/coach: Follow a coach.
6. High Query Services
The system integrates specialized query services for advanced data processing:
PlayerAggregationService: Aggregates player statistics.
UserProjectionService: Retrieves customized user-following data.
PlayerUserIntegrationService: Merges player and user interactions.
7. Security Implementation
Authentication: Users authenticate via Spring Security.
Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts access to certain endpoints.
JWT Tokens: Used for securing API requests.
8. Exception Handling
A global exception handler (GlobalExceptionHandler.java) is implemented to manage errors efficiently, ensuring API responses remain user-friendly.
9. Conclusion
The FIFA Data Management System is a well-structured, scalable application designed to handle large-scale football data efficiently. It utilizes Spring Boot, Neo4j, and RESTful APIs to ensure seamless data management and retrieval.
