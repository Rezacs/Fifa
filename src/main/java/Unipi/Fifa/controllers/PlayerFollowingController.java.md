# Unipi.Fifa.controllers.PlayerFollowingController - Internal Documentation

[TOC]

## 1. Overview

This document provides internal documentation for the `PlayerFollowingController` class within the `Unipi.Fifa` project.  This controller is designed to handle requests related to player following functionality within a FIFA-related application.  Currently, it is an empty controller, providing a foundation for future development.


## 2. Class Structure: `PlayerFollowingController`

The `PlayerFollowingController` class is a Spring REST controller annotated with `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping("api/v1/followplayer")`.

| Annotation      | Description                                                                |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@RestController` | Marks the class as a REST controller, automatically handling HTTP requests. |
| `@RequestMapping("api/v1/followplayer")` | Defines the base URL path for all requests handled by this controller. |


## 3. Methods

Currently, the `PlayerFollowingController` class contains no methods.  Future development will involve adding methods to handle specific HTTP requests, such as:

* **POST `/api/v1/followplayer`: **  This endpoint would likely handle a request to follow a specific player.  This would involve validating the request, accessing a data store (database, etc.), and updating the follow status. The implementation would need to consider error handling and potential race conditions.

* **DELETE `/api/v1/followplayer/{playerId}`:**  This endpoint would handle unfollowing a player, identified by their `playerId`.  Similar to the POST request, it would require data store access and error handling.

* **GET `/api/v1/followplayer/{playerId}`:** This endpoint could return information about whether a user is following a given player.


## 4. Future Development Considerations

The lack of methods in the current implementation suggests a planned future implementation.  Key considerations for future development include:

* **Data Access:** Defining how player following data will be stored and retrieved (e.g., using a database, in-memory storage, or a dedicated service).  The choice will depend on scalability and performance requirements.
* **Authentication and Authorization:**  Implementing mechanisms to ensure only authenticated users can modify follow status.  This could involve integrating with an authentication provider (e.g., Spring Security).
* **Error Handling:**  Implementing robust error handling to gracefully manage invalid requests, database errors, and other potential issues.  This would involve returning appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
* **Input Validation:**  Adding input validation to ensure that requests contain valid data, preventing unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
* **Concurrency Control:**  Designing the system to handle concurrent requests efficiently and prevent race conditions, especially for updating the follow status.


## 5.  Dependencies

The controller currently uses the following dependencies:

* `org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping`: For mapping HTTP requests to controller methods.
* `org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController`: For creating REST controllers.


This documentation provides a foundation for understanding the `PlayerFollowingController`.  As the controller evolves, this document should be updated to reflect those changes.
